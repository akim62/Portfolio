Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. Using the excel table provided, I modified and analyzed the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects using basic Excel manipulation techniques, conditional formatting, pivot tables, pivot charts (stacked) in order to find any important market trends.
