# The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this project you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Goals

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running it once.

* This can be applied to any of the difficulties.

### VBA Code
