PyBank Background

Using the budget_data.csv file, I created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:

-The total number of months included in the dataset

-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

-The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Exported the results to a txt file which can be found in the "analysis" folder
