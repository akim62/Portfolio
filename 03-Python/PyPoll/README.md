PyPoll Background

Using the election_data.csv file, I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

-The total number of votes cast

-A complete list of candidates who received votes

-The percentage of votes each candidate won

-The total number of votes each candidate won

-The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* Exported the results to a txt file which can be found in the "analysis" folder
